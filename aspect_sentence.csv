4253,canon,i figure that is at least three years off  and i am getting impatient .,"['i', 'that', 'i']"
4254,canon,hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations .,"['i', 'a point-and-shoot digicam', 'that', 'features', 'that', 'me', 'their inherent limitations']"
4255,canon,i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality  clean images .,"['i', 'the g3', 'its reputation', 'very high quality  clean images']"
4256,canon,the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light )  and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .,"['the two limitations', 'i', 'i', 'the very long lag time', 'it', 'bright light', 'the built-in flash']"
4257,canon,as of this writing  technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr .,"['this writing  technology', 'the focus-lock lag time problem', 'point-and-shoot digicams', 'anyone', 'who', 'it', 'a modern film slr']"
4258,canon,at least once youve got focus lock  the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second  which from what ive read  is better than just about anything else available .,"['you', 'focus', 'the shutter release lag time', 'the g3', 'a second', 'which', 'what', 'i', 'anything']"
4259,canon,what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .,"['what', 'the focus-lock lag time', 'something', 'i', 'the extreme depth', 'field', 'these point', 'shoot digicams', 'f8']"
4260,canon,once i get focus lock  i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus .,"['i', 'focus lock', 'i', 'my restless subject', 'a pet', 'a child', 'an amusing pose', 'the shutter', 'some reasonable probability', 'my subject', 'focus']"
4261,canon,now what about the flash problem ?,['the flash problem']
4262,canon,relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr  the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh  flat images with ugly hot spots .,"['what', 'i', 'external flash', 'my nikon slr', 'the internal flash', 'the g3', 'harsh  flat images', 'ugly hot spots']"
4263,canon,fortunately  the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash  and fortunately for me  i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .,"['the g3', 'a hot shoe', 'that', 'an external flash', 'me', 'i', 'the highest quality external flashes', 'that money', 'the metz 60 ct-4']"
4264,canon,i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera  but i can use my metz  with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 .,"['i', 'my nikon external flash', 'a canon camera', 'i', 'my metz', 'the proper metz module and extension cord', 'the g3', 'the 60 ct-4']"
4265,canon,for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl-3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3  the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c .,"['those', 'who', 'this metz flash', 'the 45cl-3', 'the absolute ultimate quality', 'this', 'the metz module', 'you', 'the sca', 'the connector cord']"
4266,canon,in order for this to work  you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself .,"['order', 'this', 'you', 'the camera', 'manual mode', 'the shutter speed', 'yourself']"
4267,canon,contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes  just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .,"['what', 'i', 'the g3', 'a second', 'third-party flashes', 'it', 'the dedicated flashes', 'canon']"
4268,canon,you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync  which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .,"['you', 'the g3', 'second shutter sync', 'which', 'what', 'youd', 'the time']"
4269,canon,then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel  because they are all ignored .,"['all the controls', 'you', 'the metz flash head', 'itself', 'the sca 3102 control panel', 'they']"
4270,canon,the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash  and most of the time  the exposure is spot on and when it isnt  its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself .,"['the g3', 'the duration', 'the metz flash', 'the time', 'the exposure', 'spot', 'it', 'its', 'you', 'the range', 'the metz flash', 'itself']"
4271,canon,this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing  or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away .,"['this', 'you', 'the subject', 'you', 'you', 'bounce', 'the walls']"
4272,canon,unfortunately  the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available  so the first problem cant easily be solved .,"['the neutral density filters', 'the metz flash', 'the first problem']"
4273,canon,the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) .,"['the second problem', 'more direct lighting', 'the metz', 'the attendant shadows']"
4274,canon,but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range  the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .,"['you', 'your exposure', 'an acceptable range', 'the g3', 'utterly stunning images', 'i', 'my nikon f100 film camera']"
4275,canon,the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted  enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you .,"['the 60 ct-4 flash head', '180 degrees', 'you', 'the flash', 'the walls', 'you']"
4276,canon,the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine .,"['the results', 'shadow-free images', 'that', 'they', 'the gentlest natural light', 'you']"
4277,canon,now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf  which gives me 130 raw images  as opposed to 7 !,"['one more complaint', 'i', 'the g3', 'that', 'the software', 'that', 'it', 'raw images', 'i', 'raw image mode', 'the first thing', 'i', 'the 32 mbyte cf', 'a 512 mbyte cf', 'which', 'me', '130 raw images']"
4278,canon,the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all  but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .,"['the canon software', 'raw images', 'you', 'a raw image', 'the raw image', 'it', 'all the image-affecting settings', 'the camera']"
4279,canon,i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information .,"['i', 'this', 'a second file', 'that', 'the camera', 'that', 'all this information']"
4280,canon,maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software  youd see the true  raw image that the camera actually produces .,"['you', 'those files', 'you', 'them', 'the software', 'youd', 'the true  raw image', 'the camera']"

5445,creative,first i ll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. .,"['i', 'this players hardware']"

5447,creative,not just the transfer software ( which was a hellishly horrible experience ) but also the player s software .,"['not just the transfer software', 'which', 'a hellishly horrible experience', 'the player s software']"
5448,creative,first of all  many actions that the player utilizes do nt make sense . .,"['all  many actions', 'the player', 'sense']"
5449,creative,bookmarks for example  are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. .,"['bookmarks', 'example', 'an excellent feature', 'this player']"
5450,creative,rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area  the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .,"['a directory', 'bookmarks', 'one area', 'the user', 'the track', 'the bookmark']"

5465,creative,i had never loaded my cds on to my home computer  using my work computer instead .,"['i', 'my cds', 'my home computer', 'my work computer']"
5466,creative,my office would not let me put the software on to my work computer .,"['my office', 'me', 'the software', 'my work computer']"

5468,creative,if the music had been on my home computer  the transfer would have been accomplished very quickly .,"['the music', 'my home computer', 'the transfer']"

5472,creative,while the listing process is accurate for track names ( unlike windows  reliance on the amg  which frequently gets track listings out of order )  the results can be odd .,"['the listing process', 'track names', 'windows  reliance', 'the amg', 'which', 'track listings', 'order', 'the results']"
5473,creative,the cd will be classified into a number of genres  and in multidisk sets  you can get separate classifications for different disks by the same artist and the same performance .,"['the cd', 'a number', 'genres', 'you', 'separate classifications', 'different disks', 'the same artist', 'the same performance']"

5476,creative,you can change any of these  but need to be paying attention when the information is downloaded before you copy it .,"['you', 'any', 'these', 'attention', 'the information', 'you', 'it']"
5477,creative,a somewhat more troublesome problem is that the internet site will sometimes give different discs of the same set slightly different names .,"['a somewhat more troublesome problem', 'the internet site', 'different discs', 'slightly different names']"
5478,creative,this will cause the discs not to show up together when you are looking for them on the nomad .,"['this', 'the discs', 'you', 'them', 'the nomad']"

5480,creative,other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad s operating system .,"['other tagging problems', 'i', 'the nomad s operating system']"
5481,creative,if you have two tracks with exactly the same name on one disk  it will not copy both -- it gives you the option of skipping the second or overwriting the first with the second .,"['you', 'two tracks', 'exactly the same name', 'one disk', 'it', 'both', 'it', 'you', 'the option']"
5482,creative,this is rarely a problem with any kind of popular music  but can be troublesome with classical music where tracks are identified by tempi .,"['this', 'a problem', 'any kind', 'popular music', 'classical music', 'tracks', 'tempi']"
5483,creative,i also had it happen when recording a jazz set where there were a number of outtakes of the same song without numbering them separately .,"['i', 'it', 'a jazz', 'a number', 'outtakes', 'the same song', 'them']"
5484,creative,the way to fix this is to rename the track by adding a number yourself to the end of the track listing .,"['the way', 'this', 'the track', 'a number', 'yourself', 'the end']"
5485,creative,"also  i can t understand why the software does not ignore "" the "" when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .","['i', 't', 'the software', 'the', 'it', 'the cds', 'alphabetical order']"
5486,creative,finally  making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually  and are organized by cd  which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .,"['playlists', 'the computer', 'the tracks', 'cd', 'which', 'alphabetical order']"
5487,creative,in other words  to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist  you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it .,"['other words', 'a track', 'the software', 'the computer', 'it', 'a playlist', 'you', 'the name', 'the cd', 'it', 'the track', 'the location', 'the unlisted cd', 'tracks', 'that', 'it']"
